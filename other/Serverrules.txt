Server rules


1) General rules

We do not tolerate:

- any racial slurs or any kind of insults
- advertising
- trolling or any behaviour that spoils the gaming experience of others by using unwanted game-mechanics (e.g. bug-using)
- bug-using / hacking / scripting / duping / or the like

Disregading the above will inevitably result in a ban. 



2) RDM / VDM / survivor areas

In general, there is no such thing as RDM (Random Deathmatch) or VDM (Vehicle Deathmatch) on this server, except for the survivor-zones (marked by wall and marker on map).
The specific rules for that certain area are:

- Killing a player without any roleplay-background in a survivor area is not tolerated and will be punished at the supporter's discretion.
- Running over other players without any roleplay-background in a survivor area is not tolerated and will be punished at the supporter's discretion.
- Stealing other player's in-game items or vehicles without any roleplay-background in a survivor area is not tolerated and will be punished at the supporter's discretion.



3) Support

Feel free to talk to our supporters at any times. However, if you're looking for compensation of somehow lost in-game items or the like, you will have to obey the follwing rules:

- We will refund every in-game item you lost because of unwanted server/game-related reasons (bugs, lags, unexpected shutdowns, hackers, RDM, VDM, etc.)
- Please note that we can only refund in-game items, if you have solid proof (e.g. video, convincing screenshot, etc.) of losing said items because of an above mentioned circumstance. We apologise for any inconvenience.



4) General information

Please note that there are laws for the survivor zones. However, they are not considered to be server rules. Breaking these laws will therefor not result in a ban or something like that.
